## Installation
Download the latest VexTrack_vX.X-Setup.exe from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/BitTim/VexTrack/releases/) and run the installer. After opening VexTrack for the first time, a new folder called "VexTrack" will be created in %localappdata%.

## Third Parties
This Project uses the following third projects:
- [Newtonsoft Json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json)
- [LiveCharts](https://v0.lvcharts.com/)
- [MathConverter](https://github.com/hexinnovation/MathConverter)

This Project also uses the following third party assets and services:
- [Google Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons)
- [ValorantAPI](https://valorant-api.com/)

Without ValorantAPI a lot of functions added in v2.0 would not have been possible or much harder to implement, as a lot relies on the data gathered from ValorantAPI
